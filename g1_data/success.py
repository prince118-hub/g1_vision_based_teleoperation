"""The four phase-level success criteria (proposal 3.8.2), from RECORDED data.

Everything here is a pure function of one episode .npz - `states`, `qvel` and the
metadata - plus scene geometry that Q6/TR13 fix. Nothing reads a live model, so
an episode recorded today can be re-scored months from now, and a scoring bug can
be fixed without re-collecting.

TWO OF THE PROPOSAL'S FOUR CRITERIA NEEDED WORK (D19, D20)
----------------------------------------------------------
3.8.2 scores a grasp as "both gripper states closed AND box above the platform
surface". The replay negative control (NOTES.md 2026-09-16) produced a
counter-example from real physics: with the box displaced 235 mm, the arm SHOVED
it 185 mm into its own palms, the weld gate conditions were then genuinely met,
and the episode wrecked - the box ended 3.36 m away. Both of the proposal's
conditions held. A policy that bulldozes the box into its hands would score a
grasp success, and "bulldoze until the gate fires" is exactly the kind of
degenerate strategy behavioural cloning can learn from a demonstrator it only
half-imitates.

So a third condition is added: at the instant of engage, the box must still be
near WHERE IT SPAWNED. `box_spawn_xy` is in every episode file.

    measured, 40 scripted episodes: pre-grasp box disturbance 0.1 - 2.4 mm
    threshold: 50 mm  (>20x the measured healthy maximum, and 4x below the
                       185 mm shove that motivated it)

The margin is deliberately enormous in both directions: it cannot fire on a
healthy episode, and it cannot miss a bulldoze. It is a fault detector, not a
quality metric.

THE LIFT CRITERION IS VACUOUS AS WRITTEN (D20)
----------------------------------------------
3.8.2 scores a lift as "box height exceeds platform + 0.05 m". Read as the box
CENTRE - the obvious reading, and the one the state vector hands you - a 0.18 m box
resting untouched on the platform is already 0.09 m above it, so the criterion is
satisfied before the robot does anything. A deliberately injected "welded but
never raised" episode passed it. Scored here on the box BOTTOM, which is
equivalent to 0.05 m above its resting height and consistent with
`LockConfig.lift_min` (0.055 m, the demonstrator's own "carrying" test).

WHAT IS NOT DECIDED HERE
------------------------
These are EPISODE-LEVEL OUTCOME criteria, exactly as 3.8.2 specifies. Which
BUCKET a failed episode is charged to is failure attribution and lives in
`spec.SCORED_OF` (see `attribute`); adding WALK_IN there changed the taxonomy and
not the metric set, and the same is true here.
