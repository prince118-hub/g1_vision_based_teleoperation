THE GATE CRITERION (revised 2026-09-21, NOTES.md)
--------------------------------------------------
A stage passes when its training error on 10 episodes falls BELOW the
NEIGHBOUR-AMBIGUITY REFERENCE computed for that stage's own loader configuration.

The criterion used to be "drive the loss to near zero". That is valid only when
the input determines the output, and here it does not: nearest neighbours in
observation space differ in action by more than the trained model's own error,
so "near zero" asked for something the data does not contain. The Stage 2 BC gate
failed it while sitting at the resolution the input supports. Both numbers and
the ratio are reported at every gate, always - a verdict without them cannot be
checked. See `g1_model/ambiguity.py` for what the reference does NOT mean.

If a stage fails, that is the finding. Do not add capacity, raise the learning
rate, or train longer to force it through - a failure says something specific
about the loss or the plumbing and forcing it through destroys the evidence.

WHAT IT IS NOT (C5)
-------------------
Every gate in Phase 4 runs on SCRIPTED episodes. They are smoother and more
consistent than piloted data will be, and `tracking_ok` cannot be exercised at
all by episodes recorded without a camera. Passing here does not guarantee
passing on piloted data. This script states that in its own output and writes it
into each run directory's `metadata.json`, because a caveat that lives only in a
report is a caveat that gets lost.
