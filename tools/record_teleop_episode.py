"""Record ONE teleop episode from the headless synthetic fixture, for the labeller.

    python tools/record_teleop_episode.py --seconds 22 --out recordings/teleop_ep.npz

Phase 3, second chunk. This exists for one reason: the phase labeller has to be
run on a teleop episode, where there is NO ground-truth phase column, to see
whether the derived sequence is plausible and monotone. The scripted
demonstrator cannot answer that - it has a phase machine, which teleop does not.

`run_integrated_combined.py` is not modified: `TeleopRecorder` wraps `mj_step` and
reads `main`'s frame, exactly as the scripted recorder reads `run_episode`'s. The
fixture is the same headless synthetic grasp-and-lift used since 2026-09-15, so
this needs no camera and no operator.
