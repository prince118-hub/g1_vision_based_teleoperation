"""Record demonstrations from the SCRIPTED demonstrator, with operator control.

    python tools/record_episodes.py --count 5                     # interactive
    python tools/record_episodes.py --count 5 --auto pass         # accept if all checks pass
    python tools/record_episodes.py --invariance 0                # recording changes nothing?
    python tools/record_episodes.py --ledger-summary

Phase 3, first chunk. The recorder is `g1_data/recorder.py` and is OBSERVATION
ONLY: it wraps `mj_step` and reads the demonstrator's frame. `scripted_demo.py`
is not modified, which is why the gates can still be byte-identical.

WHY THE VERDICT IS PRINTED, NOT LEFT TO THE EYE
-----------------------------------------------
Proposal 3.3.8 requires per-episode visual inspection and re-recording of
failures. An operator watching 150 episodes cannot see a 0.8 rad wrist wedge, a
2 mm pre-grasp box nudge, or a 12 mm hand-slab penetration, and those are
exactly the failures that survive into a dataset looking like successes. So each
check is printed with its NUMBER and a pass/fail, then a recommendation. The
operator still decides: ACCEPT / DISCARD / RETRY.

Thresholds are from measured populations, not taste - each one carries its
provenance below. Two of them (clearance, pre-grasp disturbance) are deliberately
set at the edge of the MEASURED demonstrator envelope rather than at zero,
because O26 is mitigated but not closed: the hand does enter the slab in every
scripted episode, and a check that fails 40/40 healthy episodes tells the
operator nothing.

RETRY, on the scripted demonstrator, reruns the same seed and gets the same
episode - it is deterministic. It is here because it is what teleop will need,
and because the ledger has to record the attempt either way.
