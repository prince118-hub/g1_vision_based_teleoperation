"""The policies. Stage 3 has ONE class: BC at K=1, chunked BC at K>1.

=============================================================================
EVERY HYPERPARAMETER IN THIS FILE IS PROVISIONAL. NONE OF IT IS TUNED.
=============================================================================
They were chosen on SCRIPTED DEMONSTRATOR data - `data/synthetic`, produced by
`g1_data/scripted_demo.py`, not by a human at the ZED. The scripted action
distribution is smoother, more repeatable and lower-entropy than piloted
teleoperation will be: the same staged raise every episode, the same cosine
eases, no reaction time, no tracking dropout, no operator correction. A width, a
depth or a learning rate that suits that distribution has no claim on the one
that replaces it.

So: nothing here was swept, searched or tuned, deliberately. The values are
ordinary ones from the behavioural-cloning literature, written down so the next
session can see exactly what was assumed. Choosing them carefully on this data
would be worse than choosing them carelessly - it would produce numbers that
LOOK tuned, and the tuning would be to a distribution that is being thrown away.

WHEN PILOTED DATA EXISTS, EVERY VALUE BELOW IS RE-OPENED. A result obtained with
these numbers on scripted data is a plumbing check, never a finding.
=============================================================================

WHY AN MLP
----------
BC here is the FLOOR: the comparison it exists for is "does chunking help" (ACT)
and "does recurrence help" (ACT-LSTM), and a floor that is itself an interesting
architecture makes both of those harder to read. The proposal's D8 adds plain ACT
precisely so the LSTM is isolated rather than confounded with chunking; the same
logic applies downward. A plain MLP with no memory, no chunk and no attention is
the honest zero point.

THE SHAPE CONTRACT
------------------
Every model in this file, and every model added later, takes

    obs : (B, W_o, 48)      and returns      action : (B, K, 22)

so `train.train()` does not change between stages. BC is the W_o=1, K=1 corner
of that contract, not a different interface: it flattens the window and emits one
timestep. It predicts all 22 dims, including the 6 constant ones - the loss masks
them, and having the head emit 22 keeps the action vector one shape everywhere,
so nothing downstream has to know which 16 were trained.

Chunked BC is the SAME class at K>1. See `BCPolicy` for why that matters.
