"""ACT, state-only: the CVAE that chunked BC is missing.

WHAT THIS ADDS, AND ONLY THIS
-----------------------------
The ladder adds one thing per rung: BC -> chunked BC adds chunking, chunked BC ->
ACT adds the CVAE, ACT -> ACT-LSTM adds recurrence. So everything here that is
not the CVAE must be the same as chunked BC's setting: the same W_o (12 for every
model, CLAUDE.md §8 2026-09-27), K = 100, the same loader, the same
`train.masked_l1`, the same loop. What ACT contributes is the
style variable z and the transformer that consumes it.

THE REFERENCE, AND WHAT WAS DROPPED
-----------------------------------
Pinned at `tonyzhaozh/act` commit 742c753c0d4a5d87076c8f69e5628c79a8cc5488,
cloned (gitignored) to `reference/act/`. Paper arXiv 2304.13705v1. Every
architectural constant below is cited to a file and line in that clone;
`docs/ACT_CORRESPONDENCE.md` carries the row-by-row table and the reasons.

Vision is DROPPED: we are state-only, in simulation, with ground-truth state, and
the research question is recurrence, not perception (correspondence table §3).
That removes the ResNet backbones, the 2-D image position embeddings and the
~300-token-per-camera image sequence, and nothing else.

    !!! THE STATE-ONLY PATH IS BUILT FROM THE REFERENCE'S *VISION* PATH !!!

`DETRVAE.forward` has a `backbones is None` branch (`detr_vae.py:132-136`) that
looks like exactly what a state-only port wants. It is unreachable - `build()`
constructs backbones unconditionally (`detr_vae.py:235-237`) - and it calls the
transformer with FOUR arguments, never passing `latent_input`, where the vision
path passes seven (`detr_vae.py:131`). Copying it yields a model with no CVAE
conditioning at all: chunked BC with an unused encoder, which would pass every
gate we have and silently make RQ2/RQ3 a comparison of a model against itself.
This file therefore mirrors the VISION path (`detr_vae.py:116-131` ->
`transformer.py:59-63`) and deletes only the image tokens. `test_act.py`'s
latent-reaches-the-decoder test is the standing guard.

THE TRANSFORMER IS REIMPLEMENTED, NOT IMPORTED
----------------------------------------------
The clone is a read-only reference outside the tracked tree, so importing from it
would make this repo depend on an untracked directory. The layers below mirror
`transformer.py` with line citations, including the two details a stock
`nn.Transformer` does not reproduce: position embeddings are added to the
attention QUERY and KEY but never to the VALUE (`transformer.py:171-173`,
`:236-244`), and the decoder returns every layer's output so the head can select
one (`transformer.py:129-141`).

ACT-LSTM IS THIS CLASS WITH `use_lstm=True`
------------------------------------------
Not a second implementation: two would let incidental differences sit inside the
measured effect of recurrence (D8). The flag adds an LSTM over the observation
window whose final hidden state becomes ONE extra token for the policy
transformer, and changes nothing else (CLAUDE.md §8 2026-09-25, Option B). The
reference has no recurrence anywhere (correspondence row 54, ADDITION).

    """State-only ACT: a CVAE whose decoder is a transformer emitting K actions.

    Shape contract, identical to every other model in the ladder so that
    `train.train()` does not change between stages:

        obs : (B, W_o, 47)   ->   action : (B, K, 22)

    `forward(obs)` is inference. `forward(obs, actions=..., action_mask=...)` is
    training and additionally returns `mu`/`logvar`. Which mode is in force is
    decided by whether the action chunk was supplied (`detr_vae.py:85`
    `is_training = actions is not None`), so a caller cannot accidentally run the
    CVAE encoder at inference — it has nothing to run it on.

    ACT-LSTM, `use_lstm=True` (D8; CLAUDE.md §8 2026-09-25, Option B): an LSTM
    reads the SAME (B, W_o, 47) window, oldest step first, starting from zero
    memory on EVERY call; its last layer's final hidden state is projected to
    `hidden_dim` and appended as a THIRD token, [latent, proprio, lstm], with its
    own one-entry position embedding. Nothing else moves: the CVAE encoder does
    not see it, `proprio` is still the flattened window, and the queries,
    decoder and head are shared. No (h, c) is passed in or kept, so no state
    crosses calls and `train._DeploymentGuard`'s carried-state check applies
    unchanged (TR31). Rejected, Option A: hidden state carried across the
    episode, which needs a sequential sampler ACT does not use.

    The LSTM modules are built AFTER every ACT module and after
    `_reset_parameters`, so construction consumes the RNG identically up to that
    point: ACT-LSTM from a seed starts with every ACT parameter bit-identical to
    ACT from the same seed, and `use_lstm=False` builds exactly the old model.
    The LSTM keeps PyTorch's default init; xavier is the reference's, and the
    reference applies it to its transformer only.

# ─── A3: temporal ensembling (INFERENCE ONLY) ─────────────────────────────────
class TemporalEnsembler:
    """reference/act/imitate_episodes.py:218-259.

    An INFERENCE mechanism. The policy is queried every tick, so chunks overlap
    and several predictions exist for the same timestep; they are combined by an
    exponential weighting over how long ago each was made:

        exp_weights = np.exp(-m * np.arange(n))      imitate_episodes.py:256
        exp_weights = exp_weights / exp_weights.sum()                    :257
        raw_action  = (actions_for_curr_step * exp_weights).sum(dim=0)   :259

    `w_0` weights the OLDEST prediction still in the buffer, and "a smaller m
    means faster incorporation" of new observations (paper §IV-A, p.5, arXiv
    2304.13705v1): with index 0 the oldest, a smaller m flattens the weights and
    gives the newer predictions more of the average. (This line previously said
    the opposite - docs/ACT_AUDIT_REPORT.md T1.) It is OFF by default
    in the reference — `--temporal_agg` is `store_true` (`:433`) — and when on it
    sets `query_frequency = 1` (`:193`).

    It touches no parameter and appears nowhere in training. Stage 3 deliberately
    excluded it so that chunked BC isolated chunking alone; it is built here
    because it is part of ACT, and whether the final comparison enables it for
    every rung or none is a decision that must be made once and applied uniformly.
