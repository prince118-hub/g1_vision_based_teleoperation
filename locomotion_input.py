"""Vision-based locomotion command strategies — for empirical evaluation.

Two candidate approaches for deriving the walking velocity command from ZED
body tracking, plus diagnostic logging so their failure modes can be measured
rather than argued about.

STRATEGY A — PelvisVelocity (the literal thesis proposal, section 3.3.4)
    Track the pelvis keypoint, compute translational velocity over a sliding
    window, threshold it, and emit a velocity command when it is exceeded.

    Known concerns to measure:
      - The pelvis is often outside the camera frame in an upper-body setup,
        producing NaN. Logged as pelvis_visible.
      - Section 3.3.8 specifies "walking in space", but a pelvis marching in
        place oscillates about a fixed point, so its NET velocity over a window
        longer than one step is near zero. Logged as vel_mag.
      - Leaning to reach for the box also translates the pelvis forward, which
        is indistinguishable from intent to walk. Logged as would_trigger.

STRATEGY B — LeanJoystick (mode-switched, after CHILD)
    Locomotion is OFF by default and outputs zero velocity. Raising both wrists
    above shoulder height for a dwell period toggles locomotion mode. While
    active, shoulder-midpoint displacement from a neutral captured at activation
    acts as a joystick: lean forward to walk, return to neutral to stop, rotate
    the shoulder line to turn.

    Rationale: CHILD gates leg-as-joystick behind an explicit gripper gesture
    and defaults to zero velocity otherwise. Declaring intent removes the
    lean-to-reach ambiguity that Strategy A cannot resolve.

Both return (vx, vy, wz) in the robot body frame, already clipped to the
validated stable envelope.

    HOLD TO MOVE, RELEASE TO STOP
    An accumulating command (press eight times to reach full speed, eight more
    to stop) makes precise approach almost impossible, because stopping is a
    separate deliberate act from not-moving. Instead each keypress refreshes a
    velocity that decays to zero shortly after you stop pressing. Hold a key to
    walk, release it to halt, tap it to inch forward.

    OpenCV reports key-down but never key-up, so "release" is inferred from the
    absence of a repeat within release_sec. Key auto-repeat makes holding a key
    produce a steady stream of events, which reads as continuous motion.
